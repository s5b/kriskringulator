# kriskringulator

The kriskringulator is an application to allocate the participant 
pairs in a Kris Kringle gift giving event. It's designed to allow 
the person doing the draw to participate without knowing who is 
giving to whom in the draw.

The application is contained in the following file:
```
./src/main/python/kk.py
```

See the beginning of the `kk.py` source file for instructions on 
how to run the application.
